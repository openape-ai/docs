# Introduction

OpenApe is the security layer for the Agentic Web. It consists of two independent systems:

## OpenApe Auth — Identity for Humans and Agents

DNS-based login using the DDISA protocol. Your domain becomes your identity provider — no OAuth servers to maintain, no SDKs to integrate. Just a DNS TXT record.

- **Humans** authenticate with **Passkeys** (WebAuthn/FIDO2) — phishing-proof by design
- **Agents** authenticate with **Ed25519 challenge-response** — same cryptographic strength, adapted for M2M
- **Passwords are explicitly prohibited** in the DDISA spec

## OpenApe Grants — Permissions for Agents

Human-in-the-loop permission system. When an agent needs to perform a privileged action, a human approves it.

- **`allow_once`** — one-time approval, consumed after use
- **`allow_ttl`** — time-limited grant (e.g. "for the next 2 hours")
- **`allow_always`** — standing permission, revocable anytime

## Dual Role: Enabler & Gatekeeper

OpenApe doesn't just secure agents — it makes them possible. The IdP controls which agents exist, and the grant system ensures humans stay in the loop where it matters.

| Without OpenApe | With OpenApe |
|---|---|
| Agents act, humans hope | Agents request, humans approve |
| No standard identity | DNS-based, domain-scoped identity |
| No audit trail | Signed JWTs, dual accountability |
| Passwords everywhere | Passkeys only, phishing-proof |

## Minimal Identity Token

The AuthN-JWT contains only what's needed:

```json
{
  "sub": "alice@example.com",
  "act": "human",
  "iss": "https://id.example.com",
  "aud": "sp.example.com",
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "nonce": "..."
}
```

- `sub` — email address (same identifier used in the login request)
- `act` — `human` or `agent`
- No name, no owner, no approver — those belong in the AuthZ layer
