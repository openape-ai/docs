# How It Works

## Login Flow (DDISA)

```
User enters email at SP
        ↓
SP extracts domain → DNS lookup: _ddisa.example.com
        ↓
Discovers IdP URL → Redirects to IdP /authorize
        ↓
User authenticates with Passkey (or Agent via Ed25519)
        ↓
IdP issues authorization code → Redirect back to SP
        ↓
SP exchanges code for signed JWT (backchannel)
        ↓
SP validates JWT (issuer, audience, signature, nonce, act)
        ↓
User is logged in ✅
```

This is a standard **Authorization Code + PKCE** flow, enhanced with DNS-based IdP discovery and Passkey-only authentication.

## Grant Flow (Permissions)

When an agent needs to perform a privileged action:

### 1. Agent Requests a Grant

```bash
POST /api/grants
{
  "requester": "agent@example.com",
  "target": "prod-server",
  "grant_type": "once",
  "permissions": ["deploy"],
  "reason": "Deploy hotfix #123"
}
```

### 2. Human Reviews

The agent's owner or designated approver sees the request in the web UI (or via notification) and approves or denies it.

### 3. Agent Receives AuthZ-JWT

On approval, the agent can request a signed AuthZ-JWT:

```json
{
  "sub": "agent@example.com",
  "act": "agent",
  "aud": "prod-server",
  "grant_type": "once",
  "permissions": ["deploy"],
  "decided_by": "alice@example.com",
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

### 4. Target Verifies

The target system validates the AuthZ-JWT: signature, audience, expiry, permissions, and optionally `cmd_hash` for exact command binding.

## apes — sudo for Agents

`apes` is a Rust binary that brings the grant flow to local privilege elevation:

```bash
apes --reason "Deploy hotfix" -- systemctl restart nginx
```

1. Authenticates to IdP via Ed25519
2. Creates a grant request (with SHA-256 hash of the command)
3. Waits for human approval
4. Receives AuthZ-JWT, verifies `cmd_hash` matches
5. Executes command as root

The binary runs with the setuid bit — it starts as root, drops privileges for network I/O, and only re-elevates after JWT verification.
