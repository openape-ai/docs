# Compliance

OpenApe is regulation-ready by design. One architecture satisfies both sides of the Atlantic.

## EU: NIS2 (Directive 2022/2555)

NIS2 requires **strong authentication** for critical systems. OpenApe delivers this without opt-in:

- **Passkeys** fulfill the strong authentication requirement (possession + biometrics/PIN)
- No extra MFA step — it's built into the login flow
- Agent authentication via Ed25519 challenge-response meets M2M standards for critical infrastructure

## USA: NIST CSF 2.0 & Executive Order 14028

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0** — Passkeys + asymmetric auth satisfy Identity & Access Management controls
- **Executive Order 14028** — requires MFA and Zero Trust for federal agencies and their suppliers
- **SEC Cyber Rules** (2023) — incident reporting aided by clean audit trails (human/agent separation)
- **CMMC 2.0** — tiered security levels naturally mapped by the grant system (`once`/`timed`/`always`)

## Why Passkeys-Only?

Passwords are explicitly prohibited in the DDISA spec. Here's what this eliminates:

| Attack Vector | With Passwords | With Passkeys |
|---|---|---|
| Phishing redirect | ⚠️ Main risk | ✅ Eliminated (origin-bound) |
| Credential theft | ⚠️ Possible | ✅ Eliminated (nothing to steal) |
| Man-in-the-Middle | ⚠️ Possible | ✅ Eliminated (challenge-response) |
| Credential stuffing | ⚠️ Common | ✅ Eliminated (no passwords) |
| Brute force | ⚠️ Possible | ✅ Eliminated (no passwords) |

## Compromised SP Analysis

What can a compromised Service Provider actually do?

**With Passkeys (current):**
- ✅ Cannot steal credentials (phishing-proof)
- ✅ Cannot impersonate users at the IdP
- ✅ Cannot use assertions for other SPs (`aud` binding)
- ⚠️ Can see claims (email, `act`) of users who log in — accepted, unclosable surface
- ⚠️ Can hijack sessions on its own service

**A compromised SP becomes a passive observer, not an active attacker.** This is a fundamental security improvement over password-based systems.

## Agent Authentication & NIS2

Agents authenticate via Ed25519 challenge-response, not passwords or passkeys:

| | Human (Passkey) | Agent (Ed25519) |
|---|---|---|
| Factor 1 | Possession (device) | Possession (private key) |
| Factor 2 | Biometrics/PIN | N/A — agents don't have fingers |
| Phishing risk | Eliminated (origin-bound) | N/A (no browser) |
| Replay protection | WebAuthn challenge | One-time challenge |

NIS2 requires strong auth for **humans**. For M2M, asymmetric challenge-response is the gold standard.

## Audit Trail

Every action is traceable:

- **AuthN-JWT** — `sub` (who), `act` (human/agent), `iss` (which IdP)
- **AuthZ-JWT** — `decided_by` (who approved), `permissions`, `cmd_hash`
- **apes audit log** — JSONL with command, grant ID, timestamp, result
