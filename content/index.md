# The security layer agents are missing.

AI agents are getting powerful. They send emails, move money, deploy code. OpenApe makes sure a human approves what matters — without slowing anything down.

::card-group
  ::card{title="OpenApe Auth" icon="i-heroicons-key" to="/getting-started"}
  DNS-based login for humans and agents. Passkeys for humans, Ed25519 for machines. One protocol, any domain.
  ::
  ::card{title="OpenApe Grants" icon="i-heroicons-shield-check" to="/ecosystem/grants"}
  Human-in-the-loop permission system. Agents request, humans approve — once, time-limited, or standing.
  ::
  ::card{title="Ecosystem" icon="i-heroicons-cube" to="/ecosystem"}
  Small, focused packages you compose as needed. Core, Auth, Grants, Nuxt modules, and `apes` CLI.
  ::
  ::card{title="Compliance" icon="i-heroicons-document-check" to="/security/compliance"}
  NIS2 and NIST CSF 2.0 compliant by design. Passkeys-only, phishing-proof, no bolt-on MFA.
